SyncQueue has 2 mutexes
1) for data modification protection
2) for which clerk to customer threads are using the queues

Idea
Clerk thread locks the queue
Clerk looks at the top, if found customer
sets identifier broadcasts to the queues cond var, then waits for signal from customer
Customer threads check if they're the head of the queue
Customer thread that is
pop self from queue
clears identifier
unlock the queue
service time simulated
signal clerk to wake up
clean up and exit
